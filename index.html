                    <h4>Day 1</h4>
                    <p>
                        I have no idea WTF I am doing. HTML is pretty straitghforward, but mastering CSS
                        gives me a pretty hard times    
                    </p>
                    <h4>Day 2</h4>
                    <p>
                        I thought I have undrestood flexbox. Well... I have not. Hours of tutorials, but
                        everything clicked on, when I actually applied the knowledge to my project. Somehow
                        I thought I can avoid using @media command and still get away with it on mobile platforms.
                        Maybe I manage later, but for know I just used @media.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Day 3</h4>
                    <p>
                        How to show people the progress I made? There are several options with several pros & cons. <br>
                        <b>Github pages hosting: </b>So far the only option I have not tried yet. To be tested. <br>
                        <b>Free hosting services: </b>It works! Although the service provider aplies some JS code inside
                        of my HTML which messes up the CSS and HTML itself. With desktop - no problem. On mobile devices - 
                        huge issue. <br>
                        <b>Paid hosting + domain: </b>Sure, I can go this path, but hey - if I am to spend money on hosting
                        I don't wanna mess it up with test webpages, do I? Will see about that. <br>
                        <b>Self hosting with apache2: </b>Nice option + the opportunity to learn something new. Unfortunatelly
                        I struggle with port forwarding, since I do not have any fixed provider/IP adress. I use my phone's 5G
                        connection to tether my notebook. The solution would be the VPN. Unfortunatelly my VPN service provider
                        does not offer the client App for Linux with port forwarding settings. For now - Windows only. Life sucks. <br>
                        <b>Hosting with onion share: </b>It works! I love it. FOSS! It is slow, it requires the end user to have
                        onion browser, it requires me to run the onion routers connection, but IT IS MINE! MY PRECIOUS!
                    </p>
                    <h4>Day 4</h4>
                    <p>
                        Allright. I have to move on. Let's do the homework. It does not have to be perfect. Just meet the requirements.
                        I still have to apply that linked stylesheet from Bootsrap or something. And fill the content. I think I am gonna
                        cheat a bit with lorem since it's such a powerful tool. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
